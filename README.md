# Project-E-448-2023
My final-year project of 2023, entitled "Design and Implementation of a Battery Input Single-Phase Pure Sine Wave Inverter for Loadshedding". I did not pass this project due to components arriving late, but I gained a lot of experience and life lessons, which I would like to share.
